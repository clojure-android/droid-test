* droid-test

  Droid-test is a small utility library that facilitates testing in
  [[http://clojure-android.info][Clojure-Android]] projects. It uses [[http://robolectric.org/][Robolectric]] to locally run tests that
  interoperate with Android classes.

  Droid-test currently provides support for the following Clojure testing
  libraries:

  - [[https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.test-api.html][clojure.test]]
  - [[http://jayfields.com/expectations/][expectations]]
  - [[http://speclj.com/][Speclj]]

** Usage

   The simplest was to use droid-test is from lein-droid. The tutorial is coming
   soon.

   It is also possible to use droid-test manually. You have to issue the
   following shell command:

   : java coa.droid_test.internal.TestRunner -mode <mode> <list-of-test-namespaces>

   `<mode>` should be either `clojuretest`, `expectations` or `speclj`. If
   `-mode` option is not provided, `clojuretest` is assumed. List of test
   namespaces should be separated by space. It goes without saying that Clojure,
   Robolectric, JUnit, droid-test, and test namespaces themselves should be on
   the classpath for this command to work.
